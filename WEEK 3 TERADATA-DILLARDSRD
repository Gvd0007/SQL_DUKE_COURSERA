Question 1
(a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in pairs of the skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables.
    Which skus are common to pairs of tables, or unique to specific tables?
    
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM skuinfo;
# 1564178

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM skstinfo;
# 760212

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM trnsact;
# 714499

# Num of distinct skus in skuinfo > in skstinfo > in trnsact

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.sku)
FROM skuinfo a
	JOIN skstinfo b
		ON a.sku = b.sku;
    
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.sku)
FROM skuinfo a
	JOIN trnsact b
		ON a.sku = b.sku;
    
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT a.sku)
FROM skstinfo a
	JOIN trnsact b
		ON a.sku = b.sku;
    
Results

Combi	  Pair 1	  Pair 2	  Distinct SKU
  1	   skuinfo	 skstinfo  	  760212
  2	   skuinfo	 trnsact	    714499
  3	   skstinfo	 trnsact	    542513

To test which SKUs are in which tables:

SELECT a.sku, b.sku
FROM skuinfo a
	LEFT JOIN skstinfo b
		ON a.sku = b.sku
WHERE b.sku IS NULL;

SELECT a.sku, b.sku
FROM skuinfo a
	LEFT JOIN trnsact b
		ON a.sku = b.sku
WHERE b.sku IS NULL;

All items in SKSTINFO are listed in SKUINFO, but not vice versa
All items in TRNSACT are listed in SKSTINFO, but not vice versa

b) Use COUNT to determine how many instances there are of each sku associated with each store in the skstinfo table and the trnsact table?

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(sku)
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku, store;

Seems like there's only 1x sku-store combo in the SKSTINFO table.

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(sku)
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku, store;

Seems like there's multiple instances of each sku-store combos in the TRNSACT table.

Notes from lecture: You should see there are multiple instances of every sku/store combination in the trnsact table, 
but only one instance of every sku/store combination in the skstinfo table. Therefore you could join the trnsact and skstinfo tables, 
but you would need to join them on both of the following conditions: trnsact.sku= skstinfo.sku AND trnsact.store= skstinfo.store.

Exercise 2
(a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct stores there are in the strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, and trnsact tables.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM strinfo;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM skstinfo;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM store_msa;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM trnsact;

Table Name	Unique Stores
STRINFO      	453
SKSTINFO	    357
STORE_MSA	    333
TRNSACT     	332

(b) Which stores are common to all four tables, or unique to specific tables?

Since we know that ALL stores can be found in the STRINFO table, we can left join the three other tables to it.

SELECT a.store, b.store, c.store, d.store
FROM strinfo a 
  LEFT JOIN skstinfo b 
    ON a.store = b.store
  LEFT JOIN trnsact c 
    ON a.store = c.store
  LEFT JOIN store_msa d
    ON c.store = d.store
    
Exercise 3
It turns out there are many skus in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table. As a consequence, we will not be able to complete many desirable 
analyses of Dillard’s profit, as opposed to revenue, because we do not have the cost information for all the skus in the transact table 
(recall that profit = revenue - cost).

Examine some of the rows in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table; can you find any common features that could explain why the cost information 
is missing?

SELECT * 
FROM trnsact a 
  LEFT JOIN skstinfo b
    ON a.sku=b.sku AND a.store = b.store
WHERE b.sku IS NULL 

This returns a table with all columns, of rows of items which are in TRNSACT but not in SKSTINFO.
There are 52,338,840 rows, or 43.3% of 120 billion rows that are missing.

To check how many of them are unique:

SELECT distinct a.sku, a.store
FROM trnsact a 
  LEFT JOIN skstinfo b
    ON a.sku=b.sku AND a.store = b.store
WHERE b.sku IS NULL 
GROUP BY a.sku, a.store;

That leaves exactly 17,816,793 sku-store combinations found in the transactions table that are not listed in the master skstinfo table.

Exercise 4
Although we can’t complete all the analyses we’d like to on Dillard’s profit, we can look at general trends. What is Dillard’s average profit per day?

With over 40% of the necessary data missing (see Qn 3), whatever data we have left is accurate and worth calculating.
For each transaction recorded (row), only 1 type of item is purchased at a time. In other words, that:
Total amount paid per transaction = number of items x price of each item.

This is important because if each transaction contains numerous items of different prices, we will lack necessary information about unique compositions of 
each transaction to make this query.

Profit = revenue - cost

This can be written as

PROFIT = trnsact.amt - (trnsact.quantity * skstinfo.cost)

Further, since we want to know the average profit, we can find the number of days by diving the profit by count(distinct saledate).

SELECT SUM(a.amt - a.quantity*b.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT a.saledate) -- avg profit
FROM trnsact a
  LEFT JOIN SKSTINFO b
    ON a.sku = b.sku AND a.store = b.store
WHERE a.stype = 'P'; -- purchases only

This returns an average profit of $1,527,903.46 per day. 

The average profit for Register 640 should be $10,779.20.

SELECT SUM(a.amt - a.quantity*b.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT a.saledate)
FROM trnsact a
  LEFT JOIN SKSTINFO b
    ON a.sku = b.sku AND a.store = b.store
WHERE a.stype = 'P'
  AND register = '640';

The answer is correct.

Exercise 5
On what day was the total value (in $) of returned goods the greatest?

SELECT saledate, sum(amt)  -- I didnt limit this cos I'm kaypoh 
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate 
ORDER BY sum(amt) DESC
limit 1;

Sale date 	Total value of returned goods
04/12/27	     $3,030,259.76

On what day was the total number of individual returned items the greatest?

SELECT saledate, sum(quantity) 
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate 
ORDER BY sum(quantity) DESC
LIMIT 1;

Sale date	Total num of returned goods
04/12/27	82512


Exercise 6
What is the maximum price paid for an item in our database? What is the minimum price paid for an item in our database?

SELECT max(orgprice)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

SELECT min(orgprice)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

SELECT max(sprice)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

SELECT min(sprice)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'P';

SELECT max(retail)
FROM skstinfo;

SELECT min(retail)
FROM skstinfo;

Source	        Max price	 Min price
skst.retail     	6017.00	  0.00
trnsact.orgprice	6017.00  	0.00
trnsact.sprice	  6017.00 	0.00

Exercise 7
How many departments have more than 100 brands associated with them, and what are their descriptions?

SELECT DISTINCT a.dept, b.deptdesc, count(distinct a.brand) 
FROM skuinfo a
  LEFT JOIN deptinfo b
    ON  a.dept=b.dept 
GROUP BY a.dept, b.deptdesc
HAVING count(distinct a.brand) > 100;

There are three departments iwth more than 100 brands associated, and these are their descriptions:

Department ID	Description	Num brands
4407	ENVIRON	389
7104	CARTERS	109
5203	COLEHAAN	118

Exercise 8
Write a query that retrieves the department descriptions of each of the skus in the skstinfo table.

SELECT a.sku, c.deptdesc
FROM skstinfo a 
  LEFT JOIN skuinfo b 
    ON a.sku = b.sku 
  LEFT JOIN deptinfo c
    ON b.dept = c.dept;

The department description for SKU5020024 is LESLIE.

Exercise 9
What department (with department description), brand, style, and color had the greatest total value of returned items?

SELECT d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color, SUM(t.amt)
FROM skuinfo s LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
ON s.dept = d.dept
LEFT JOIN trnsact t 
ON s.sku = t.sku
WHERE t.stype = 'R'
GROUP BY d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color
ORDER BY SUM(t.amt) DESC;

# 4505    POLOMEN    POLO    FAS    4GZ 782633    U KHAKI

Exercise 10
In what state and zip code is the store that had the greatest total revenue during the time period monitored in our dataset?

Note: There is an error in the notes. The question asks for state and city instead of zip. 
The assignment statement provided (below) suggests that you should know the city too.

"If you have written your query correctly, you will find that the department with the 10th highest total revenue is in Hurst, TX."

SELECT b.state, b.city, SUM(a.amt) -- no need to include sum(a.amt), but this is good for checking.
FROM strinfo b
  LEFT JOIN trnsact a
    ON a.store = b.store
WHERE stype = 'P'
GROUP BY b.state, b.zip
ORDER BY SUM(a.amt) DESC;

State	ZIP	   City	          Total Revenue
 LA	 70002	METAIRIE	      $24,171,426.58
 AR	 72205	LITTLE ROCK	    $22,792,579.65
 TX  78501	MCALLEN	        $22,331,884.55
 TX	 75225	DALLAS	        $22,063,797.73
 KY	 40207	LOUISVILLE	    $20,114,154.20
 TX	 77056	HOUSTON	        $19,040,376.84
 KS	 66214	OVERLAND PARK	  $18,642,976.76
 OK	 73118	OKLAHOMA CITY	  $18,458,644.39
 TX	 78216	SAN ANTONIO	    $18,455,775.63
 TX	 76053	HURST	          $17,740,181.20
 
 The answer is correct. The store with the 10th highest revenue is Hurst City with $17,740,181.20.
